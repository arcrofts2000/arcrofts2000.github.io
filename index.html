                            <p>Hi! I'm Adam. This website is my Portfolio of my time as a Game Developer / Software Engineer. I have been doing this properly for 2 years since starting Computer Games Development at Liverpool John Moores University. Currently my main goal (aside from finishing university) is to find a suitable job within the industry that I think I will benefit from as much as the company I am applying for. So far I have made around 7 games / projects in full and working on 2 as I am writing this. One thing I am passionate about in the industry is the players. Without them this industry just wouldn't exist, so it is a priority for me that updates for games are released quickly but efficiently! Aside from Game Development, I enjoy spending my free-time watching TV (Lucifer is the BEST) and playing games like Fortnite, Minecraft, and Boneworks.</p>

                                        <p>Created as part of the Wowie Jam 2.0 using Unity 5. Consists of simple tilt controls on Android and Cursor control using PC. For this project, I worked for 3 days on my own, creating everything from scratch including the code to move the player and the art used in the game. I was pleased with the results so decided it would make a great Mobile game since it was inspired by the likes of Flappy Bird and Doodle Jump. Programmed in C#</p>

                                        <p>Created in my first year of Uni, in which we were given a proprietary university game engine and told to create Space Invaders but sideways. In this project, one of my favourite features I implemented was a boss fight every 5 rounds using a Modulo function to check if the Level is a multiple of 5. The boss was just a scaled up variant of the Player character that moves up and down the screen while firing bullets in 8 different directions every 2 seconds. This I feel is a very difficult challenge for the Player, so makes it all the more satisfying when you manage to beat it! Programmed in C++</p>

                                        <p>I was given the task of creating a top down zombie shooter using C++ and SFML. For this project, I had to learn some basic functionalities of AI enemy creation - including the use of hearing and visual cones so the enemy can identify if the player is nearby. I also had to create a type writing effect for the backstory menu, along with a Day / Night cycle. There is also a couple of different weapons available for the player, consisting of both Melee and Rifles. I finally implemented a Zombie spawning system to make sure that the player will always have something available to fight. The sprites were all provided by the university. </p>

                                        <p>I had a module for 3D Computer Graphics, in which I had to create a 3D World with a Car driving along a racetrack to show off different types of Transformations. To properly do this module, I had to do a lot of research into the different types of transformations and how changing one can affect the others, especially if done in the incorrect order. My research is available on the download link too.</p>
